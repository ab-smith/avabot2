# Introduction

**AvaBot2** brings the ultimate experience of having an **ava**tar ro**bot**  by combining virtual reality with augmented reality.

# Current version

The current version demonstrates the concept (still a POC for now) by providing the control of a **Mindstorms EV3** through a **Leap Motion** sensor.
The code is written in java mode on **Processing**.
